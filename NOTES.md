# NOTES

Most of my feedback is sprinkled in as comments throughout the code.

I wrote an example program in `./example/` (do `make run` to see output), to show how you can do less hard-coding of logic with simpler functions.

# POSITIVE FEEDBACK

I like that you use a very consistent style for indentation / code blocks.
And even though it's not a great pattern (globals), your error handling is also consistent.

It's cool that you put the thought in to have comprehensive error messages

+1 for learning the lost art of Makefile's, a lot of people HATE Makefiles and just stick to IDEs, but make
is still widely used and will give you a better understanding of build environments.

+1 for writing tests!
